## Note:
Included communication nRF24L01P "Stanek". Fixed RF channel, fixed address. 
Channel reduction 2 -> 12ch. This is the maximum in the "Servo" library on the Atmega328P processor. 
Telemetry A1 for measuring 1S Lipo power supply RX and TRSS. 
Support for Arduino-based receivers and RF24 library from this repository [RC_RX_nRF24L01_Telemetry_Motor_Driver_Servo](https://github.com/stanekTM/RC_RX_nRF24L01_Telemetry_Motor_Driver_Servo). 
Thanks to "Bracame Ingwie" from the [OpenAVRc](https://github.com/Ingwie/OpenAVRc_Dev) team for the code base.

Operated in SPI mode.
* OpenAVRc v3.0 Alpha 20

If necessary, I update with the latest version.
