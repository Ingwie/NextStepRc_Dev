 * There is amplification on the stick inputs, but the sliders are fed direct into the ADC.
 * The 5V regulator has a worst case error of +/-3%, typically +/-0.4% at 25'C
 * See Atmel document AVR121 (and M2560 datasheet) about the reduction in E.N.O.B. (Effective Number of Bits)

 * We use a 250KHz ADC clock as this should provide accurate 10 bit resolution.
